# Data-Engineering-Coding-Challenge---Solution
The Reverb platform generates an immense amount of log data that data engineers are responsible for collecting, parsing, and analyzing. This code is written to address the problem without taking help of python regex library

It answers following questions:
What are the top 5 most accessed URLs on the site?
What is the average session time in milliseconds across all users? The median? The max? The min?



It is comman to use regex library to perform text analysis in python. The reason behing using only regex over other libraries is simplicity regext provides. But same time, coming up with complext regex expression is difficult for person who is new to python. 
Moreover, a small mistake in the expression leads to unwanted output. 

This python script is written without taking help of any regex function. This scrpt will tell you how we can solve complex coding challege in JSON with help of regular libraries. Its a consise code which is solution to Reverb's Data Engineering Coding Challege.
